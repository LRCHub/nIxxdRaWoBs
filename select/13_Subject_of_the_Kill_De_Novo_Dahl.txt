We got big things going on
You're the conductor of this train
Is this cerebral?
Look at the death toll spreading all across the land

There's such a big deal going down
We've been crawling on our knees
It's a long shot, but it's all I've got
Spreading through my bloody veins

Subject of the kill, we'll go on
Bringing back the thrill, 'till it's gone
Offer up the goods, take it home
Bleed me 'till it's good, real good
Never mind the pain, we'll go on
And I'll never blame, because it's wrong
Anyone who claims that they're not gonna stop until it feels so good

You got a big power going on
The grade was made through such big trials
Here's snapshot of the grave plot dug by my own blistered hands

Subject of the kill, we'll go on
Bringing back the thrill, 'till it's gone
Offer up the goods, take it home
Bleed me 'till it's good, real good
Never mind the pain, we'll go on
And I'll never blame, because it's wrong
Anyone who claims that they're not gonna stop until it feels so good
