[00:25.06] Adds every moment longer had no time for fun
[00:47.06] 
[00:29.20] Just something that I knew I had to do
[00:33.89] But through it all I left my eyes on you
[00:53.89]

[00:53.18] Oh I used the tactics make everybody pay
[01:13.18]

[01:01.82] But through it all I kept my eyes on you
[01:21.82]

[01:37.97] No kings of misuse no sellers of flesh
[01:56.97] 
[01:42.26] Just something that I knew I had to do
[01:46.74] But through it all I kept my eyes on you
[02:06.74]

[01:55.71] But through it all I kept my eyes on you
