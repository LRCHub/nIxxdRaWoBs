Times are changin'
We'd best beware
The world is in the electric chair
The state holds out its loving cup
Singing power to the people
But their power's corrupt
Burning crosses and secretly
Carry swastikas and M 16s
Nevermind the pages of history
It just keeps repeating, keeps
Repeating

It's always the same
Seems like nothing will ever change
We pay to wear the blindfold
But look out

'Cos they're movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Yankee Doodle leadin' lambs
To slaughter
Just for the thrill

Good things come to those who wait
Good advice just a bit too late
Any chance for trust went up in smoke
When a preacher's lust was sponsored
By coke

Day after day
It's always the same
We pay to wear the blindfold
Baby look out

'Cos they're movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Disbelievers drink the poisonwater
Time stands still

Don't fill my eyes, fill my head
Till I'm overloaded
You talk and you talk and you talk
But I don't hear anything

Times are changin'
There ain't no cure
It's a wasteland
One thing's for sure
Ain't no gold to grind the axe
So keep your fingers crossed
While you're crossin' the tracks

'Cos good blind faith ain't
Good enough
Baby's heat crumbled to dust
Hooray for the Outlaw
Keeps movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Yankee Doodle leadin' lambs
To slaughter
Just for the thrill

Don't fill my eyes, fill my head
Till I'm overloaded
You talk and you talk
You know I don't hear it anymore

But you keep on movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Yankee Doodle leadin' lambs
To slaughter
Just for the thrill

My word's no good, it's
Not enough

Straight out of Abilene
He's bustin' at the seams
Immune to whisky
Man it's down to a shot of
Gasoline
This ain't no Romeo
This here's a one man show
Livin' on a dare
Thinkin' he'll become a legend

One more fever diggin' for
Fools gold
Fast lane freeway to the
Glory hole
'Cos he's

Livin' it up
In No Man's Land
Tonight's the night
Gonna get to heaven
Livin' it up
In No Man's Land
Too fast to live
Too young to die

He named his limousine
The Mississippi Queen
Better never look inside
'Cos things get a little
Bit messy
This party never ends
Plenty of so-called friends
Payin' homage to heroes
They will never see again

Where will you wind up
I'll never know
Fast land freeway to the
Glory hole
'Cos he's

Livin' it up
In No Man's Land
Tonight's the night
Gonna get to heaven
Livin' it up
In No Man's Land
Too fast to live
Too young to die

One more fever diggin' for
Fools gold
Fast lane freeway to the
Glory hole
The headline read
He finally made it
No return
Baby see him fly

Livin' it up
In No Man's Land
Tonight's the night
Gonna get to heaven
Livin' it up
In No Man's Land
Too fast to live
Too young to die
